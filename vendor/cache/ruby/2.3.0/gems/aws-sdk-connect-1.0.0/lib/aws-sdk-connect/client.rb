    # @option options [required, Aws::CredentialProvider] :credentials
    #   Your AWS credentials. This can be an instance of any one of the
    #   following classes:
    #
    #   * `Aws::Credentials` - Used for configuring static, non-refreshing
    #     credentials.
    #
    #   * `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials` - Used for loading credentials
    #     from an EC2 IMDS on an EC2 instance.
    #
    #   * `Aws::SharedCredentials` - Used for loading credentials from a
    #     shared file, such as `~/.aws/config`.
    #
    #   * `Aws::AssumeRoleCredentials` - Used when you need to assume a role.
    #
    #   When `:credentials` are not configured directly, the following
    #   locations will be searched for credentials:
    #
    #   * `Aws.config[:credentials]`
    #   * The `:access_key_id`, `:secret_access_key`, and `:session_token` options.
    #   * ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    #   * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #   * `~/.aws/config`
    #   * EC2 IMDS instance profile - When used by default, the timeouts are
    #     very aggressive. Construct and pass an instance of
    #     `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentails` to enable retries and extended
    #     timeouts.
    #
    # @option options [required, String] :region
    #   The AWS region to connect to.  The configured `:region` is
    #   used to determine the service `:endpoint`. When not passed,
    #   a default `:region` is search for in the following locations:
    #
    #   * `Aws.config[:region]`
    #   * `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
    #   * `ENV['AMAZON_REGION']`
    #   * `ENV['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']`
    #   * `~/.aws/credentials`
    #   * `~/.aws/config`
    #
    # @option options [String] :access_key_id
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :convert_params (true)
    #   When `true`, an attempt is made to coerce request parameters into
    #   the required types.
    #
    # @option options [String] :endpoint
    #   The client endpoint is normally constructed from the `:region`
    #   option. You should only configure an `:endpoint` when connecting
    #   to test endpoints. This should be avalid HTTP(S) URI.
    #
    # @option options [Aws::Log::Formatter] :log_formatter (Aws::Log::Formatter.default)
    #   The log formatter.
    #
    # @option options [Symbol] :log_level (:info)
    #   The log level to send messages to the `:logger` at.
    #
    # @option options [Logger] :logger
    #   The Logger instance to send log messages to.  If this option
    #   is not set, logging will be disabled.
    #
    # @option options [String] :profile ("default")
    #   Used when loading credentials from the shared credentials file
    #   at HOME/.aws/credentials.  When not specified, 'default' is used.
    #
    # @option options [Integer] :retry_limit (3)
    #   The maximum number of times to retry failed requests.  Only
    #   ~ 500 level server errors and certain ~ 400 level client errors
    #   are retried.  Generally, these are throttling errors, data
    #   checksum errors, networking errors, timeout errors and auth
    #   errors from expired credentials.
    #
    # @option options [String] :secret_access_key
    #
    # @option options [String] :session_token
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :stub_responses (false)
    #   Causes the client to return stubbed responses. By default
    #   fake responses are generated and returned. You can specify
    #   the response data to return or errors to raise by calling
    #   {ClientStubs#stub_responses}. See {ClientStubs} for more information.
    #
    #   ** Please note ** When response stubbing is enabled, no HTTP
    #   requests are made, and retries are disabled.
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :validate_params (true)
    #   When `true`, request parameters are validated before
    #   sending the request.

    # @!group API Operations

    # The `StartOutboundVoiceContact` operation initiates a contact flow to
    # place an outbound call to a customer.
    #
    # There is a throttling limit placed on usage of the API that includes a
    # `RateLimit` of 2 per second, and a `BurstLimit` of 5 per second.
    #
    # If you are using an IAM account, it must have permissions to the
    # `connect:StartOutboundVoiceContact` action.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :destination_phone_number
    #   The phone number, in E.164 format, of the customer to call with the
    #   outbound contact.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :contact_flow_id
    #   The identifier for the contact flow to execute for the outbound call.
    #   This is a GUID value only. Amazon Resource Name (ARN) values are not
    #   supported.
    #
    #   To find the `ContactFlowId`, open the contact flow to use in the
    #   Amazon Connect contact flow designer. The ID for the contact flow is
    #   displayed in the address bar as part of the URL. For example, an
    #   address displayed when you open a contact flow is similar to the
    #   following:
    #   `https://myconnectinstance.awsapps.com/connect/contact-flows/edit?id=arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:361814831152:instance/2fb42df9-78a2-4b99-b484-f5cf80dc300c/contact-flow/b0b8f2dd-ed1b-4c44-af36-ce189a178181
    #   `. At the end of the URL, you see
    #   `contact-flow/b0b8f2dd-ed1b-4c44-af36-ce189a178181`. The
    #   `ContactFlowID` for this contact flow is `
    #   b0b8f2dd-ed1b-4c44-af36-ce189a178181 `. Make sure to include only the
    #   GUID after the "contact-flow/" in your requests.
    #
    # @option params [required, String] :instance_id
    #   The identifier for your Amazon Connect instance. To find the
    #   `InstanceId` value for your Amazon Connect instance, open the [Amazon
    #   Connect console][1]. Select the instance alias of the instance and
    #   view the instance ID in the **Overview** section. For example, the
    #   instance ID is the set of characters at the end of the instance ARN,
    #   after "instance/", such as 10a4c4eb-f57e-4d4c-b602-bf39176ced07.
    #
    #
    #
    #   [1]: https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/
    #
    # @option params [String] :client_token
    #   A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
    #   idempotency of the request. The token is valid for 7 days after
    #   creation. If a contact is already started, the contact ID is returned.
    #   If the contact is disconnected, a new contact is started.
    #
    #   **A suitable default value is auto-generated.** You should normally
    #   not need to pass this option.**
    #
    # @option params [String] :source_phone_number
    #   The phone number, in E.164 format, associated with your Amazon Connect
    #   instance to use to place the outbound call.
    #
    # @option params [String] :queue_id
    #   The queue to which to add the call. If you specify a queue, the phone
    #   displayed for caller ID is the phone number defined for the queue. If
    #   you do not specify a queue, the queue used is the queue defined in the
    #   contact flow specified by `ContactFlowId`.
    #
    #   To find the `QueueId`, open the queue to use in the Amazon Connect
    #   queue editor. The ID for the queue is displayed in the address bar as
    #   part of the URL. For example, the `QueueId` value is the set of
    #   characters at the end of the URL, after "queue/", such as
    #   `aeg40574-2d01-51c3-73d6-bf8624d2168c`.
    #
    # @option params [Hash<String,String>] :attributes
    #   Specify a custom key-value pair using an attribute map. The attributes
    #   are standard Amazon Connect attributes, and can be accessed in contact
    #   flows just like any other contact attributes.
    #
    #   There can be up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all key-value pairs.
    #   Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, dash, and underscore
    #   characters.
    #
    #   For example, to play a greeting when the customer answers the call,
    #   you can pass the customer name in attributes similar to the following:
    #
    # @return [Types::StartOutboundVoiceContactResponse] Returns a {Seahorse::Client::Response response} object which responds to the following methods:
    #
    #   * {Types::StartOutboundVoiceContactResponse#contact_id #contact_id} => String
    #
    # @example Request syntax with placeholder values
